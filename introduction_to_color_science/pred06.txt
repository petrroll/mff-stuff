Munsell COS
- Hue
	- 5 basic colors + 5 between + 0 - 9 scale between them
		-> 5 is exactly between 2 colors
- Value
	- 1-10
	- 
- Color space 
	- non-linear because of perceptual reasonsss
	- 

Natural Color System
- swedish, good designers
- standard for interior design
- mainly color appearence

- Hue
	- 6 basic colors (without purple)
	- %black%chromaticnessY90R
	- Primalex uses NCS
		- many builders use NCS
	
RAL design
- small atlas
- they took care to make the colors easily manufacturable


Beamers
- 3D movies - the beamer can't be brighter because of physical limits
		- screen big and glasses filter another part of the light 
		- too much heat from light

- laser beamers
	- really beatyful colours
	- we don't waste any light on filtering
	
	- small ones
		- red and blue lasers are common
		- green laser have been created only recently
		- in this boxes they use native green diodes
		
- the whole movie industry moved to much larger color space lately
	- anticipation of better technology?

Reproduction
- photographic film
	- only really durable
	- high contrast, good color gamut
- Russia, 1910
	- take 3 photographs with red, green and blue colors
	- then colored the negatives and gave it together
	- no color degradation
	- travelled around Russia
		-> many colorful images of Russia from ~1910

Printers
- CMYK
	- non-linear
		- teoretically linear, but not in reality
	- printable color space is smaller, than the one displayable
	- in green and blue we can print what can't be displayed
	-> solved by gamut mapping
- Gamut mapping
	- global
		- trying to shrink all the points inside the printable area
		- the difference between details stays the same
	- local
		- projection of the points outside of the colour space into it
		- destroys the relation between neighbouring details
		- (-8, 5, -10) the negative values can't be projected on 0, because that would change the hue
		- actually we need to project the color in the direction to the white point
			-> iterative methods
