CME principle
- it is possible to represent all colours with 3 representants
- but not single 3 ones
-> reason why negative red is needed

- sometimes we need the distance between colors
- for example order of some product, +- distance ?
- circle around x,y

- MacAdams's Ellipses
- not circles, ellipses
- we are sensitive in the lower part of the x,y,z digagram

- different people see different ellipses, also the same person in different time has diffrent results

- 1960 - people are trying to stretch the diagram to make the ellipses circles
- partially successful
- it is important to understand that this is a 3D problem, as luminiscence is also non-linear

- 1976 - scientists asking people from movie and printing industry
- film industry quite ... with CIE 1960 -> L*u*v
	- has maximum
	- the color is dependent on the maximum light in your scene
	- incadescent ilumination	
		- color of light
		- we can normalize it quite quickly in our brain
		. we can stab to the colour of our light
	- the cut through the central part is also not linear (ellipses instead of circles)
	- not much in use
- designers wanted something, where coordinates made sense -> L*a*b
	- a b are axes
	- a is red-green, b is yellow-blue
	- in photography, we change b to balance the white
	- 
- in both systems hue can be expressed through angle and luminiscence through the distance from center
- we can also count hue difference (for a designer, the distance in luminiscence is not so bad as in hue)

- LCH - Lab in radial coordinates
- CIE 94 - computing the difference in LCH space with correction coeficients (domain specific)
	- to make it most linear for different domains
- CIEDE200 - adding another part to the difference equation 
	- RT - blue rotation
	- quite complicated
	- implementation can be downloaded
	- always check your implementation with the sample one

- there is no colour space perfect for every task

- CIELAB - not perceptually uniform
	- some corrections in the way of counting the difference

Beyond colour spaces
- device colour spaces (RGB, CMYK)
- colour metric spaces (Lab, Luv)
	- roots in colorimetry, to measure values and differences
- colour ordering spaces (munsell, coloroid)
	- to find colour of some property

- people are trying to make color samples

Colour collections
- primary aim to provide a list of numbered sample colours
- no ordering - not a color space
- usually some order
- used in product specifications
- physical samples provided usually, matching is done against them

RAL-Farben
- RAL classic - box of colours 
	- RAL 4010 for example
	- loose standard, guide
	- how much does my colour differ from the sample is between me and customer
	- no sorting
	- delta i - under 1 not perceptable, over two perceptable, over 5 huge difference

FS 595
	- five digit numbers
	- enumeration of colours for U.S. military purposes

Pantone
	- enumeration of colours and a specification of how to get them
	- one can get certified colorants and then he can get certified colors through the receipts
	- only some of it can be obtained by the standard CMYK


- people compare colours on day light
-> there are boxes which can simulate the standardised light conditions

Colour ordering systems
- Absolute COS
	- RAL Design, Munsell 
	- each entry associated with unique colours

- Relative COS
	- HSV, HLS
	- front-ends to colour spaces
	- HSV coordinates are not unique

TV colour spaces
- NTSC - backword compatible solution
- YIQ
- YuV
- YCbCr
- luminance abbreviated as Y
-
