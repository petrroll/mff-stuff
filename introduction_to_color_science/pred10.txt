Printers
- it is hard to calibrate them
- if we wanted to do it the same as with monitors, we would need to print hundreads of pages
- every printer uses different technology, different paper
- the behaviour is non-linear
- usually, colour wedges are printed
	- they have linear scale whith different shades of black and other colours
	- important is that every segment is different from the one next to him
	- we can notice the rest of it e.g. on tetra pack 

Paper Type characteristics
	- tone value increase
	- how much ink is soaked into the paper
		- through TVI
			- a raster with dots of different size is printed (dots are lineary greater and greater) 
			- then the size of dots is measured
			-> TVI curve - difference of reality and what has been printed
		- is slightly non-linear to the amount of ink

Video installations and virtual reality
- on buildings etc.
- an ability to light a beamer on a surface to make it white and without structure
- then other colors and stuff can be added
- not only colours, but space calibration
- virtual reality has been used to find out how spiders get orientated in the space

White Balance, Colour Appearance Transform (CAT)
- colour constancy
- chromatic adaptation - what our brain does
- white balance - what we need the camera to do to make the colours see the same
	- sometimes we don't want to do it - e.g. sunset looks horrible
	- it's goal is to make the picture seem the same as it perceived the person how took it
	- not only eyes compensate the picture in a way, but also brain
	- even laptops have now the ability to adaptate the monitor to the intensity of light
	
- algorithms for white balance - determining iluminant
	- white patch
		- assumes that brightest pixel is white
	- gray world
		- assumes that on average there are all values from white to black
		- basically getting the center of gravity to the middle
		- doesn'ŧ work well with highly colourful scenes
	- gamut constraint
		- assumption is that the colour space of picture have the same shape as the one in reality
		-
	- robotics - make the robot to find a yellow ball
		- it is really hard
		- the RGB values can't be hard-coded
   
- algorithms for white balance - determining how would the picture look like with different illuminant
	- matrix adaptation
		- transformation matrix, source and destination white as input

- people can tell apart white box in orange light and orange box in white light, which shouldn't be possible
	- still not understood
	- a colour scientist has a theory, that the direct ilumination is the same, but the indirect not
		- indirect ilumination of white on orange gets more orange with every refraction
		- indirect ilumination of orange on white doesn't change
		

Raytracing
- counting where the ray coming into the eye has come from 

CWNI - Colured World, Neutral Iluminants
- uses raytracing, but without light source
- then chroma of that is counted and subtracted from the original image
	-> we get non-colurful stuff
	- then the extract the colour of iluminant from that
- used to do the correction
